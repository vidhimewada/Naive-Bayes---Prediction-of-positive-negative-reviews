Implementation of Naive Bayes algorithm

This project is based on the implementation of the algorithm Naive bayes for predicting the positive and negative reviews out of the dataset.
The algorithm uses predefined stopwords to increase the effeciency and accuracy.

Compilation :

1. Change the path of the directory and test set in the String array a and b written in driver.java file.

2. Set path of the directory and test folders of spam and ham through the "path" variable.

3. Results will be written out in 'result.txt' along with the accuracy with/without the stopwords.
